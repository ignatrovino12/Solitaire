The rank of cards in Solitaire is: K (high), Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A (low).

There are five different types of piles in Solitaire:

1. The Tableau: Seven piles that make up the main table.
2. The Foundations: Four piles on which a whole suit or sequence must be built up.
3. The Stock Pile: The remaining cards after the tableau is completed.
4. The Show Pile: The 3 or less cards next to the stock pile that are drawn and can be used.
5. The Waste Pile: The cards chosen not to be used and that wait to return to the stock pile.

How to play:

You can click on the stock pile to start drawing cards. If the cards fit in the tableau
they can be moved accordingly (they need to be smaller with one than the tableau card and
to have the opposed colour). Also any card can be placed in the foundation, but they 
need to be placed in ascending order. Any card from the tableau can be moved in the
foundation or back in the tableau and when a card faced downwards will have no other
card on it, the card will face up as well. Only K-s can be placed on blank spaces in 
the tableau. The point of this game is to complete the foundations.
